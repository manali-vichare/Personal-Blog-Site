Financial literacy is the skill of making informed money decisions. With a few simple systems, you can reduce stress and let time do the heavy lifting.

## 1) Budgeting that actually works

- Track cash flow monthly: income minus essential expenses (rent, food, utilities, transport)
- Set simple targets: needs (~50%), wants (~30%), saving/investing (≥20%)
- Automate: schedule transfers the day you get paid

> If your budget requires willpower every day, redesign the system — don't rely on discipline.

## 2) Build an emergency fund

- Target 3–6 months of essential expenses
- Keep it in a high-yield savings account (liquid, low risk)
- Start with a mini-goal: $1,000 as a first buffer

## 3) Tackle debt strategically

- List debts with balance, rate (APR), and minimum payment
- Choose a method:
  - Avalanche: pay highest APR first (mathematically optimal)
  - Snowball: pay smallest balance first (motivational)
- Always pay at least the minimums on all debts; automate the extra toward your chosen target

## 4) Invest early and consistently

- Use tax-advantaged accounts first (e.g., 401(k)/IRA or local equivalents)
- Prefer low-cost, diversified index funds over stock-picking
- Time in the market beats timing the market

### The power of compounding

Even modest returns add up when you contribute consistently. After many years, growth comes more from returns on returns than from new contributions.

## 5) Protect your plan

- Insure against large risks (health, disability, liability)
- Separate short-term spending from long-term investing (different accounts)
- Revisit your plan annually or after big life changes
